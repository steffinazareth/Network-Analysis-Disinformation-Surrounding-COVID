# Network Analysis : Disinformation Surrounding COVID-19

During this project we:
1. Used tools like NetMapper and ORA to create, clean and visualize networks from a dataset containing 315k tweets.
2. Performed Leiden grouping to separate the tweets into three major disinformation storylines and identified hashtags commonly associated with each storyline.
3. Employed stance detection and measures of centrality to identify bots and key actors continuing to promote disinformation despite it being declared fake by health/government organizations.

This repository includes a [Presentation](Presentation.pdf) with more details about this project.
